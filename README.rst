Moshe Zadka
===========

There are three things that make me happy:

* Reliability
* Python
* Twisted

I am having the best time if I'm using Python
to make things more reliable.
If Twisted can be used to help,
that's a big bonus.

If you want to get in touch with me,
my website
cobordism.com_
lists my contacts for each communication medium known to humankind.
The best way,
though,
is to use e-mail.
My commitment to
`Inbox 0`_
is unwavering.
